# MNSIT-ANN-model
building artificial neural network for MNSIT dataset for classification of digits from their hand written images which are represented as 2D arrays of size 28*28.
1. 'relu' activation is used for hidden layers
2. 'softmax' is used for output, it performed better than 'sigmoid'.
3. most classification error is between 3 and 8
